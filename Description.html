			<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>Toddler's Locker is a website dedicated to how toddlers interact, behave, and their preferences in their little worlds. This website also talks about the common issues with toddlers, such as why some toddlers are having difficulty learning how to speak. Alongside the issues, some solutions are shared on this website.</p>
			
			<h1>Purpose</h1>
				<p>The purpose of this website is to tell people about the world of our 	little ones. This website was created to share how our kids see our world from their perspective. Toddler's Locker also aims to spread awareness about the problems and issues of toddlers, from their immune system up to some behavioral issues. And with this website, we might be able to handle toddlers much better as we further understand how they think.</p>
