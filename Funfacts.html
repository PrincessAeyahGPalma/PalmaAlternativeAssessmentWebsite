			<h1>Fun Facts</h1>
		<h2>Fun Fact #1</h2>
			<p>During the toddler years (around ages 1 to 3), a child's brain develops more than at any other time in their life. <br> They can form new neural connections at an astonishing rate, which is crucial for language acquisition and cognitive skills.</p>
		<h2>Fun Fact #2</h2>
			<p>Toddlers have a unique ability to negotiate in the most unexpected ways. <br> For instance, they might insist on wearing their superhero cape to the grocery store, completely oblivious to the fact that it's not typical attire. <br> Their confidence in these "fashion choices" can leave parents both amused and bewildered! </p>
		<h2>Fun Fact #3</h2>
			<p>Toddlers are just beginning to understand and express their emotions. <br> They often experience intense feelings and may not yet have the vocabulary or skills to articulate them, leading to tantrums or other expressive behaviors.</p>
		<h2>Fun Fact #4</h2>
			<p>Toddlers often mispronounce words in hilarious ways, creating their own unique vocabulary. <br> For example, they might call a "banana" a "nana" or a "cereal" "see-wee-ow." <br> These adorable mix-ups can lead to laughter and countless cute moments as parents try to decode their little onesâ€™ language!</p>
		<h2>Fun Fact #5</h2>
			<p>Toddlers are naturally curious and love to explore their environment. <br> This is an important part of their learning process, guiding them to understand the world around them through play, experimentation, and interaction.</p>
